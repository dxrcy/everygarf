    add to readme
    add arg docs

feat: overhaul error handling
    difference between cloudflare 429 vs other 429?
    document variants
    rename variants

feat: use mpsc to send error to main?

doc: document public items
doc: readme
    make better
chore: linting
    standardize `use` statement order
refactor: refactor and clean up modules
    too many items in `lib.rs`

feat(test): add tests
    unit test simple functions

perf: save raw bytes to file, instead of converting to image, when saving as .gif
    this might be a little annoying to change

    can be removed if gocomics accepts leading zeros
    maybe just replace with manual `format!`
